# Frankfurt App
Hey! <br> This bot will help you learn foreign words. For example, you have a habit of learning words every day by reading various newspapers or magazines such as the New York Times. Add new words to this bot, and then, during the day, we will send you a new word every hour along with the translation, and you will try to memorize them. At the end of the day you will have the opportunity to take a short test to check how well you remember the words.

## Here are the main bot commands you will use

1. **/add_words** - with this command you start entering new words that you want to learn. One message - one word with translation. Words must be sent in the “word-translation” format. When you have entered all the words, send the /finish_add_words command. After this command, you will receive notifications with words every hour during the day.
2. **/todays_vocabulary** - with this command you will get a list of all the words that you have added for today.
3. **/learn_todays_words** - with this command you can start a test to check the learned words. You will receive a translation of the word, and you must answer with the word.
