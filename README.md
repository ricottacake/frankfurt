# Decks & Cards
This bot application was created based on the format of decks and cards for memorizing foreign words or expressions. There are two main entities here - decks and cards. Each deck can contain up to 10 cards. Each card has two sides - front and back. A foreign word will be written on the front side, and a translation into the native language will be written on the back. The application supports deck building, creating and adding cards to decks, deleting cards and decks, and learning mode. The learning mode allows you to select a deck for memorizing words, then the bot will send a word in your native language, and you must translate it into a foreign one.
